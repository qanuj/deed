                                    Deed A Day chapters are affiliated groups that work closely with our team to make a difference in their local communities. Often taking the form of school clubs or independent volunteer groups, Deed A Day chapters recruit volunteers, establish their annual goals, hold fundraising and awareness building events in their local community. Our chapters are core to our strength - we rely on our chapters to raise funding through events, spread awareness about our education causes, brainstorm and execute creative campaigns, and help us connect with more people. Starting a Givology chapter is a powerful way to make an impact and inspire your community to act! Check out our chapters page for more details and to find a chapter near you!.
