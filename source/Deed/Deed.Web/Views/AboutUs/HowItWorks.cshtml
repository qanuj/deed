                                <h3>How your one Deed can make a difference?</h3><br/>

                                <p>Even though you may be oceans away, you have an opportunity to change the life of a needy child and his or her community. Not only is education a basic human right, but it breaks intergenerational chains of poverty, improves health outcomes, spurs economic growth, combats gender inequality, empowers choice, and promotes peace globally.</p>

                                    <p>We started DeedaDay with the philosophy that small pounds and small volunteer hours aggregate into a powerful force for change. We wanted to create an online community where personal connections really matter and that regardless of the size of our donation, we'd get regular updates, full transparency, and maximum impact per shillings spent. Here's how DeedaDay works:</p>

                                <h3>Browse</h3><br />

                                <p>Once you register for an account, check out the different student and project profiles on DeedaDay. With our background in international level education, we seek out partnerships with grassroots education and post their highest priority funding needs. We only select partners that meet our strict standards for impact evaluation, deep relationships with the community, local hands-on focus, proven track record, and innovation. That way, we provide our DeedaDay community with pre-screened causes that effectively deliver change every day.</p>

                                <h3>Sponsor</h3><br />

                                <p>Once you add money to your DeedaDay wallet, you can allocate it to the different education projects and scholarships that resonate with you. Our dashboard makes it easy for you to track your impact portfolio and monitor for updates. For every shillings donated100% of it go to our projects and sponsored students.</p>

                                <h3>Interact</h3><br />

                                <p>Our mission is to make sponsoring interactive - to create a community and full experience around sponsoring education. Through our messaging function, you can send a letter to our students which we translate and deliver. In the regular updates that we receive and post online, you'll find that our students often respond! We encourage you to blog about your experience and join a DeedaDay volunteer Team. Through your dashboard, you can log your volunteer hours for DeedaDay, post updates to your social media networks, and track your impact over time. Moreover, we hope that you consider starting a DeedaDay chapter in your local community or considering joining our team to help us make our mission even better.</p>
